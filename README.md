## Code

- AutoTar knee

  AutoTar is proposed in paper *Autonomy and Reliability of Continuous Active Learning for Technology-Assisted Review*.
  The key component of *AutoTar knee* is a knee detection method, which is proposed in paper *"Kneedle" in a Haystack: Detecting Knee Points in System Behavior*.

  We implemented the method ourselves.

- SCAL
